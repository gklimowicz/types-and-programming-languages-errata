Errata for TYPES AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES  (2nd printing)
==========================================================

This section lists all the errors that I'm aware of in the second
printing of TAPL (not counting the errors listed above).  They should be
corrected in the third printing.

SUBSTANTIVE ERRORS
------------------

p 96, second line of proof of 8.3.2 [[gak: in TAPL web errata]]

    T-IsZero should be T-Zero

    This error does *not* appear in the first printing.  :-(

p 280: [[gak: in TAPL web errata]]

    The citations for early papers on syntactic properties of recursive
    types (without subtyping) should also mention an paper by Claude
    Pair, published in Algol Bulletin n. 31, March 1970, which contains
    what appears to be the first proof of the decidability of equality
    for equi-recursive types.

    A scanned copy of the paper has kindly been made available by Pierre
    Lescanne, at the following URL:

p 354, Theorem 23.6.2 [[gak: in TAPL web errata]]

    The cited articles by Boehm (85 and 89) actually prove a slight
    variant of the stated result.  Other variants (closer to the stated
    one) can be found in Pfenning (1993a).  Surprisingly, though, the
    decidability of precisely this partial type inference problem appears
    still to be open.

p 502, solution to 5.3.6 [[gak: missing from TAPL web errata]]

    In the full beta-reduction rules, one is missing:

               t1 -> t1'
            ---------------  (E-Abs)
            \x.t1 -> \x.t1'

    Also, na1' in rule E-App1 should be renamed t1'.
