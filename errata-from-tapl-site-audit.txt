Errata for _Types and Programming Languages_.

(Many thanks to Eijiro Sumii and Gary Klimowicz for helping curate these!)

Errata are organized by page, naively sorted within the page.  Text in
square brackets lists the source, and an indicator of the severity of the
error:
    no mark denotes VERY trivial errors
    *  marks denote trivial errors
    ** marks denote less trivial errors  :-)

p. xxi [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    Erik Hilsdale's name is spelled with a k
    Fermin Reig's name should be typeset Ferm\'{\i}n

p. xxi, line 14 [Sumii]
    "Narciso Marti-Oliet"
    ->
    "Narciso Mart\'{\i}-Oliet"

p. 7, "C#" [Sumii *]
    The # should not be superscript, and should be a "number sign"
    (not a "music sharp sign") according to the official language
    specification.

p. 15 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    The font used for (the set) T in 2.1.1 and 2.1.5 is inconsistent with
    the rest of the chapter.  Ditto U in 2.1.5.

p. 16, Definition 2.1.7, "The codomain or range of R" [Sumii **]
    This terminology is not standard.  Usually, "codomain" means only
    T, while "range" means either T or {t \in T | \exists s. (s,t) \in
    R} (as defined here), depending on the literature.

p. 19 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    "P(0)" should be slanted in 2.4.1

p. 25 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    "in under" --> "under"
    "is does not" --> "does not"

    The paragraph beginning "for brevity" would make more sense if it
    were moved just before the example higher on the page.

p. 27 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    concete --> concrete

p. 28, 11th line from the bottom [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
     S_i should be S_j (that is, it should read "t_1, t_2, t_3 are elements
     of S_j")

p. 28, line -12 [Sumii]
    "by condition (2)"
    ->
    "by condition 2"

p. 35, after the displayed program fragment [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "using E-If" should be "using E-IfTrue"

p. 40, Exercise 3.5.13 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 494, solution to exercise 3.5.13 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 40, Exercise 3.5.13 [Sumii]
    The solution has an error; see p. 494, Lemma A.1 [Sumii]

    "containing"
    ->
    "satisfying"

p. 41, definition 3.5.15 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    the word "closed" is not needed here.

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.16 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 496, solution to 3.5.16 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.16 [Sumii]

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.16 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 497, subcase g1 = succ g1 [Pierce 1st ed. **]

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.17 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 499, Lemma A.8, E-IfTrue and E-IfFalse cases [Pierce 1st ed. **]

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.17 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 499, end of A.8 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 42, Exercise 3.5.17 [Sumii **]
    The solution has an error; see p. 499, Proof of Proposition A.9 [Sumii **]

p. 45, line 8 [Sumii]
    "implementation sections"
    ->
    "implementation chapters"

p. 47, near the middle [Sumii]
    "the result of the evaluation function yields no result"
    ->
    "the evaluation function yields no result"

p. 49, Exercise 4.2.1 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 499, 4.2.1 [Pierce 1st ed. **]

p. 53, footnote 2: [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "the behaviors of some languages constructs"
    should be
    "the behaviors of some language constructs"

p. 56 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    the middle item in the first sample reduction sequence has an extra
    pair of parens

p. 57 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    all occurrences of "call by X" should be hyphenated (except,
    arguably, the first use of "call by need")

p. 57, definition of call-by-value [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "a term that is finished computing..." should be "a CLOSED term that is
    finished computing..."

p. 57, definition of call-by-value [Sumii *]
    Like call-by-name, the call-by-value evaluation strategy also
    forbids reductions inside abstractions.

    By the way, the online errata
    (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/errata.txt) adds "closed"
    to the (informal) definition of values here, but not all values
    are closed according to the formal definitions given in later
    chapters.

p. 61, Exercise 5.2.4 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]

    "c x (c y (c z n))"

p. 66, Exercise 5.2.11 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 501, solution to 5.2.11 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 67, Figure 5-2 [Sumii]
    The last periods in lines 18, 21, and 28 should be removed.

p. 67, figure 5-2 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    the reduction from
       times c3 (fct (prd c3))
    to
       times c3 (fct c2')
    is not valid in call-by-value semantics -- the application of times
    to c3 should be reduced first.

p. 71, last line of display near top of page [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    There should be a close-paren after the second t1.

p. 71, last line [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    the RHS should (arguably) be parenthesized to match the corresponding
    line at the top of the page

p. 72, line 5 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "values can be arbitrary lambda-terms" should read "values can be
    arbitrary lambda-abstractions"

p. 73, exercise 5.3.8 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    4.2.2 should be 3.5.17

    The solution has an error; see p. 503, solution 5.3.8 [Pierce 1st ed. **]

p. 76, exercise 6.1.1 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    the combinator called "plus" does not implement the addition function
    (the solution in the back is correct, though)

p. 78, Exercise 6.1.5 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 503, solution to 6.1.5 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 78, line 2 [Sumii]
    Add a "," before "x1".

p. 78, second line of 6.2 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "To to" -> "To do"

p. 79, exercise 6.2.3 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    The statement to be shown is not quite true for d < 0.  To be true for
    n>=0 and any integral d, it should be "Show that, if t is an n-term and,
    if d < 0, the free variables of t are all at least |d|, then <shift t up
    by d above cutoff c> is a (max(n+d,0))-term."

p. 80, line 6 [Sumii]
    "([j|->s]t1 [j|->s]t2)"
    ->
    "([j|->s]t1) ([j|->s]t2)"

    Also, all the parentheses on the left hand sides of this
    definition should be in typewriter (heavy) font.

p. 87 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "As in chapter 3" should be "As in chapter 4"

p. 96, second line of proof of 8.3.2 [Pierce 2nd ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 2]]
    T-IsZero should be T-Zero

    This error does *not* appear in the first printing.  :-(

p. 96, second to last line of T-If case in proof of 8.3.2 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    T-If should be E-If

p. 97, T-If case in proof of 8.3.3 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    E-True and E-False should be E-IfTrue and E-IfFalse

p. 102, footnote 1: [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "they will be sometimes be elided"
    should be
    "they will sometimes be elided"

p. 104, Exercise 9.3.2 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 506 [Pierce 1st ed. **]

p. 104, proof of Theorem 9.3.3 [Sumii *]
    The exercise would be [Recommended, ***].

p. 104, Exercise 9.3.3 [Sumii]
    The solution has an error; see p. 506, near the middle [Sumii]

p. 106, proof of 9.3.8 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "By induction on a derivation" should be "By induction on the depth
    of a derivation"

p. 107, end of first para [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    The annotation on y should be T2, not T1

p. 107, Preservation theorem (and other preservation theorems throughout [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
       the text)

    The theorem is correct as stated, but we don't really need this
    powerful a version of it for present purposes.  Since (a) we have
    chosen only to be interested in evaluating closed terms and (b) the
    evaluation strategy is call-by-value (so evaluating a closed term
    only involved evaluating closed sub-terms), there is no reason for
    Gamma ever to be non-empty.

p. 108, Exercise 9.3.10 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 507, solution to 9.3.10 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

    "the variable type @'a@" should be "the type variable @'a@"

p. 118, line 2 [Sumii *]
    "with variables and type variables"
    ->
    "with variables"

p. 120, Theorem 11.3.1 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    The first part of the Theorem doesn't hold, for a couple of reasons.
    First, the statement in the "if" direction should read:

    if e(t) -> u, then there is a lambda-E term t' such that u = e(t') and
    t -> t'

    Second, the E-SeqNext rule should be changed to read

    v1; t2 -> t2

    (with v1 in place of unit), to match the semantics of E-AppAbs.

p. 121, Exercise 11.3.2 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 507, solution to 11.3.2 [Pierce 1st ed. **]

    ->
    "both tuples and records"

p. 130, second paragraph, second sentence [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "affect" should be "effect"

p. 130, Exercise 11.8.2 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The solution has an error; see p. 510, top of page [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 130, Exercise 11.8.2 [Sumii *]

    "Matching rules:"
    ->
    "Matching rules"

p. 136, figure 11-11: [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    the value syntax for variants is missing.  It should read:

       v ::= ...
             <l=v> as T

    also, "field labels" would be better called "variant labels" here.

p. 137, paragraph 3 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    "finite mappings" should be "partial mappings"

p. 142 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    top line is garbled (some latex markup for index entries got into the
    text instead)

p. 142, line 4 [Sumii]
    A space should be removed before |.

p. 144, line 4 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    T should be T1

p. 146 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    Lists are not implemented in the fullsimple checker.

p. 146 [Pierce 1st ed. **] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    footnote 9 is redundant with Exercise 11.12.2.

    ->
    "v1,...,vn"

p. 152, line 1 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    The first heavy open paren should be dropped.

p. 152, "Tait's strong normalization proof corresponds exactly [Sumii **]
    to an algorithm for evaluating simply typed terms, known as
    normalization by evaluation or type-directed partial evaluation"

    Actually, normalization by evaluation (or type-directed partial
    evaluation) corresponds to _weak_ normalization; see
    http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/slides/Leicester.pdf for
    example.

p. 155, first line [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]]
    missing "of" between "result" and "the"

p. 162, 166 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    The notation for extending stores with new mappings is a little
    inconsistent ("[l |-> v2]\mu" in some places and "\mu, l |-> v1" in
    others).  Note, though, that "[l |-> v2]\mu" assumes l \in \dom(\mu)
    while "\mu, l |-> v1" assumes the converse (so perhaps having two
    notations is useful).

p. 162, Exercise 13.3.1 [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL errata solution; cross-ref]]
    The solution has an error; see p. 515, solution to 13.3.1 [Pierce 3rd ed.]

p. 167, definition 13.5.1 (and following material) [Pierce 3rd ed.] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 3]]
    It would be better to fix an empty context here rather than allowing an
    arbitrary one.  (See the comment above for p. 107.)

p. 411 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
    The whole of chapter 27 is not very convincing.  The purpose in using
    Fsub is supposedly to enable us to create the method table just once per
    class, rather than once per object.  The code indeed manages to have it
    create something just once for each class, but that something is a
    *function* that creates the method table *at every open self recursive
    call*!  (See the "(!self r)" calls that happen during a method
    invocation.)  In other words, the final efficiency is worse than what we
    ended up at the end of Chapter 18.

    Many thanks to John Tang Boyland for pointing this out!  John also
    proposes a different case study, using f-omega-sub in the style of chapter
    32 to implement objects in an imperative style.  A sketch of the main
    constructions can be found here:

    "....  But this means that size(T1) is strictly greater than size(T1

    [It is impossible because all types in this system have finite size.]

    Also, there is no formal definition of the "size" of a type.  This can
    be taken to be the number of nodes in its tree representation.

p. 512, Solution 12.1.7 [Pierce 1st ed. *] [[gak: in TAPL pierce errata 1]] [[gak: missing from TAPL web errata]]
    The case for T-If proceeds by induction on T.  This is more complicated
    than necessary. By the induction, we know R bool t1, R T t2 and R T
    t3. Since we know R bool t1, we know that t1 halts and is a bool. Hence,
    the conditional will evaluate either to t2 or to t3. Then, by
    preservation of R under evaluation, it suffices to show R T t2 or R T
    t3, but they are immediate by induction.  [Thanks to Edsko de Vries.]

p. 512, Solution 12.1.7 [Sumii *]
    Apply the online errata (for the 1st printing) but replace t1, t2,
    and t3 with \sigma t1, \sigma t2, and \sigma t3, respectively.

p. 515, solution to 13.3.1 [Pierce 3rd ed.]
     The restriction to finite memories is not absolutely necessary -- we
     can also talk about garbage collecting an infinite memory.  But it
     makes part 5b more interesting

     E-RefV should be modified to add that the new location l must be in L.

     The text in part 5 is a little mangled.  In 5a, what is meant is that,
     if evaluation is possible with GC, then the same evaluation is possible
     *in an infinite store* without GC, but this is not what is written.
     Similarly in part b.

     (We might also be interested in comparing runs of the same program with
     respect to a *finite* store, with and without the GC rule.  For
     example, if the program runs to completion without GC, it should reach
     the same result with GC, though perhaps with renamed labels.)

     Also, note that progress and preservation depend on a store typing, and
     in the current statement of preservation the store typing only
     increases.  With gc, we need to be able to "gc the store typing" too.

    It is not quite true that (mu S) only relates finite types: every type
    (even an infinite one) is a subtype of Top.  A more complex argument is
    needed here.

    In the second paragraph, "follow" should be "can" and "byu induction on
    the size T" should be "by induction on the sum of the sizes of S and T."
