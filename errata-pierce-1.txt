Errata for TYPES AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES  (1st printing)
==========================================================

The following errors appear only in the first printing -- they should all
be corrected in the second printing (Summer, 2002).  The errors listed
above are also present in the first printing.


SUBSTANTIVE ERRORS
------------------

p xxi

    Erik Hilsdale's name is spelled with a k
    Fermin Reig's name should be typeset Ferm\'{\i}n

p 71, last line of display near top of page

    There should be a close-paren after the second t1.

p 96, second to last line of T-If case in proof of 8.3.2

    T-If should be E-If

p 97, T-If case in proof of 8.3.3

    E-True and E-False should be E-IfTrue and E-IfFalse

p 107, end of first para

    The annotation on y should be T2, not T1

p 146

    footnote 9 is redundant with Exercise 11.12.2.

p 168, para 3, line 5

    \mu should be \Sigma in "or else it is exactly ..."

    also, in line 7 of the paragraph below Thm 13.5.3
    (\mu, l \mapsto v_1) should be [l \mapsto v_1]\mu

p 208, chapter quote

    Mannasse should be Manasse

p 226, footnote 1:

    "Other languages, such as  and , ...".  The words "Java" and "C++"
    are missing

p 268, picture

    the braces in "{nil: , cons: }" should look like "<nil: , cons: >"

p 320, Example 22.2.2

    The last solution is wrong.
    Correct alternatives include:
       ( [ X |-> Nat -> Nat -> Nat, Y |-> Nat ],  Nat -> Nat )
    or ( [ X |-> Nat -> Nat, Y |-> Nat ],  Nat )

p 321, para 1, 3rd to last line

    t_1 should be T_1

p 324, line 3

    "Is a solution for (Gamma, t2, S2, C)"
    should be
    "Is a solution for ((Gamma,x:T1), t2, S2, C)"

p 325, lines 3 and 4

    T2 should be S2 in the third line and T1 should be S1 in the fourth
    line.

p 394

    In the rule S-All, the premise "Gamma |- U1 :: K1" should be omitted.

p 425, lemma 28.4.1, case 1:

    ``Suppose that $\Gamma$ is a'' should be ``Suppose that $\Delta$ is a''

p 497, subcase g1 = succ g1

    The argument for this subcase should conclude "From this derivation,
                                    w
    we construct a derivation of g -->* if wrong then g2 else g3, which
                                                   w
    after a final instance of E-If-Wrong yields g -->* wrong

p 499, Lemma A.8, E-IfTrue and E-IfFalse cases

    the second t_2 should be t_3

p 499, 4.2.1

    the constructor 'Some' was incorrectly typeset (twice) as \exists

p 503, solution 5.3.8

    t' should be called v

p 505 to 507

    exercise 9.4.1 is misfiled (it can be found between 9.2.3 and 9.3.2)

p 506 solution to 9.3.2

   "....  But this means that size(T1) is strictly greater than size(T1
   -> T2), ..." should read "... size(T1) is equal to size(T1 -> T2) ..."

  [It is impossible because all types in this system have finite size.]

  Also, there is no formal definition of the "size" of a type.  This can
  be taken to be the number of nodes in its tree representation.

p 507, solution to 11.3.2

    The conclusion in T-Wildcard should read
         Gamma |- \_:T1.t2 : T1->T2
    not
         Gamma |- \_.t2 : T2

p 538, lines 1 and 8

    $X \subseteq P$ implies $F(X) \subseteq P$
    should be
    $F(P) \subseteq P$

    (Fixed in later printings?)

p 541, proof sketch of Lemma A.17

    The first sentence should read "By induction on k = mu-height(S)."

========================================================================

GRAMMATICAL / TYPOGRAPHICAL / COSMETIC ERRORS
---------------------------------------------

p 15

    The font used for (the set) T in 2.1.1 and 2.1.5 is inconsistent with
    the rest of the chapter.  Ditto U in 2.1.5.

p 19

    "P(0)" should be slanted in 2.4.1

p 25

    "in under" --> "under"
    "is does not" --> "does not"

    The paragraph beginning "for brevity" would make more sense if it
    were moved just before the example higher on the page.

p 27

    concete --> concrete

p 56

    the middle item in the first sample reduction sequence has an extra
    pair of parens

p 57

    all occurrences of "call by X" should be hyphenated (except,
    arguably, the first use of "call by need")

p 71, last line

    the RHS should (arguably) be parenthesized to match the corresponding
    line at the top of the page

p 142

    top line is garbled (some latex markup for index entries got into the
    text instead)

p 155, first line

    missing "of" between "result" and "the"

p 220, exercise 16.3.4

    15-5 should be 15.5

p 301

    'An sample' -> 'A sample'

p 303, line 13

    "Q \in T \times T" should be "Q \subseteq T \times T"

p 303, line -8

    "we claim that R={...}" -> "we claim that R={...} is such a set"

p 334, para 1, line 1

    "One caveat is here that" should be "One caveat here is that"

p 334, last full paragraph

    "in the right-hand sides of other lets---rather than in their bodies,
    where nesting of lets is common---" should be cut (in Mairson's example,
    each let is nested in the previous one's body)

p 338, para 4, 2nd to last line

    "e.g. using by" should be "e.g. by using"

p 433, l -4

      \Gamma U \/ T = J.

    should be replaced with

      \Gamma |-> U <: V.  By the induction hypothesis, \Gamma |- U \/ T = J
      for some J with \Gamma |- J <: V.  By the third clause in the
      definition, \Gamma |- S \/ T = J.

p 439, para 3, line 2

    "type constructorstype operators" should be just "type constructors"

p 444, footnote

    wrong font for '

p 488, first sentence of 32.10

    it introduced => it was introduced

p 500, solution 5.2.4

    the names of the arguments m and n should be exchanged

p 512, solution to exercise 12.1.7

    The case for T-If proceeds by induction on T.  This is more complicated
    than necessary. By the induction, we know R bool t1, R T t2 and R T
    t3. Since we know R bool t1, we know that t1 halts and is a bool. Hence,
    the conditional will evaluate either to t2 or to t3. Then, by
    preservation of R under evaluation, it suffices to show R T t2 or R T
    t3, but they are immediate by induction.  [Thanks to Edsko de Vries.]
